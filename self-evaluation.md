# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? 
    - The each method is very useful if you need to do an action for each part of an array. When arrays get a lot bigger it would be unwise to type out a line of code for each element in the array. With the each method you can do it with only one block of code.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - When I originally did challenge #2 I didn't think about the fact that I needed to store the new alphabatized array in order to then run the each method. I was able to fix it once I realized, but I need to pay more attention to small details like that.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - Just testing with irb whenever I have an idea. There's no point in just sitting around thinking about it when you can test in a low-stakes environment.
